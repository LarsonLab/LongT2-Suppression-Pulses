# LongT2-Suppresion-Pulses
Long-T2 suppression RF pulses for MRI of short and ultrashort T2 components

Ultra-short echo time (UTE) and zero echo time (ZTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for visualization of tissues with very short T2 relaxation times. This tissues, which include collagen-rich tisuses such as tendons, ligaments and menisci, as well as calcifications, myelin, periosteum and cortical bone, are normally invisible with conventional MRI techniques.

Long-T2 species suppression is required for many UTE/ZTE applications to improve the contrast of short-T2 species. We have developed new long-T2 RF suppression pulses. This page provides descriptions and Matlab files for designing these pulses, as well as providing some sample pulses.
